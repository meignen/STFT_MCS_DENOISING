# STFT_MCS_DENOISING
Programs related with multicomponent signal denoising based on STFT
This Matlab packet contains the programs of the paper entitled "On multicomponent signal denoising and mode reconstruction from short-time Fourier transform"

In this paper, we investigate the reconstruction and denoising of multicomponent signals from their downsampled short-time Fourier transform. We first recall signal reconstruction techniques based on short-time Fourier transforms and how to use them for signal denoising.We then investigate how to adapt the proposed denoising technique to the context of multicomponent signals. Comparisons with recently developed techniques based on synhrosqueezing conclude the paper.
